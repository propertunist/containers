= containers for elgg 1.8 =
adds a dropdown selctor to the edit/save forms of common elgg mods such as blogs, pages, files, videolist and tidypics to allow the container to be set for the current item.
available containers are the user profile of the current user and the groups to which the user is associated (a member). this allows all items to be added from the same 'add new' page and also allows items to be moved between groups.
